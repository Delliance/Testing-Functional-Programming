Consumer

The Java Consumer interface is a functional interface that represents a function that consumes a value without
returning any value. A Java Consumer implementation could be printing out a value, or writing it to a file, or over the
network etc. Here is an example implementation of the Java Consumer interface:

    Consumer<Integer> consumer = (value) -> System.out.println(value);

This Java Consumer implementation prints the value passed as parameter to it out to System.out.
